  <h1 class="title">Tool Competition</h1>

  <p>This year as well we are pleased to announce the tenth edition of the testing tool competition. The
    competition has the goal to experiment with testing tools for a diversified set of traditional and
    emerging systems and domains.</p>

  <p><strong>Java tool competition</strong>: As for recent years, we invite researchers to participate in the
    competition with their unit test generation tool for <strong><em>Java</em></strong>. Tools will be
    evaluated against a benchmark with respect to code coverage and mutation score.</p>

  <p><strong>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) testing competition</strong>: In addition to the traditional Java
    tool competition, we also organize a CPS testing competition on self-driving cars simulation environments.
    Specifically, in collaboration with the <a href="https://beamng.gmbh/research/ " target="_blank">BeamNG
      research team</a>, this competition focuses on the generation of scenarios using BeamNG self-driving
    cars simulator.
